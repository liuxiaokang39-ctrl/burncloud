//! What this crate exposes to another crate, and the one piece of it that can be tested without aria2
//! (#633, plan item 28).
//!
//! The crate is ~276 lines and had **no tests**. Its plan asks for a download state machine, cancel races,
//! resume policy, progress boundaries, task identity, path normalization and restart reconciliation -- and the
//! crate types it as `U` with a **small local HTTP file** for the `I` half.
//!
//! ## Why this file is about reachability rather than behaviour
//!
//! `DownloadManager`'s methods live in two modules that `lib.rs` declares as private:
//!
//! ```text
//! mod error;  mod manager;  mod monitor;  mod operations;  mod utils;
//! pub use manager::DownloadManager;
//! ```
//!
//! An inherent `impl` block is not a path item, so whether those methods are callable from another crate is a
//! question about the compiler rather than about the module keyword -- and **this file answers it by calling
//! one**, which is the only honest way. If `DownloadManager::new` is reachable here, the private modules do not
//! block the public API; if it is not, the crate is unusable as a library.
//!
//! ## What cannot be reached from here, and why
//!
//! `extract_filename_from_url` is `pub(crate)` in a private module, so an integration test is the wrong place for
//! it and it is tested inline in `utils.rs` instead.
//!
//! Everything on `DownloadManager` that touches aria2 cannot be exercised here at all: `new()` starts an aria2
//! daemon through `quick_start()`, `add_download` spawns a progress monitor, and the rest make JSON-RPC calls.
//! The plan allows a small local HTTP file for the `I` half, but this crate has no seam for injecting an aria2
//! client -- `DownloadManager` holds a concrete `Arc<Aria2Manager>` and a concrete `Arc<DownloadDB>` -- so the
//! honest position is that the request/response behaviour belongs to `download-aria2` (item 29), whose plan
//! says so, and not to this file.

/// test_download.rs` calls it from outside.

    // `async fn`s, so they are functions returning futures. That the failure was a *type* error and not a

    // through the re-exported type.
